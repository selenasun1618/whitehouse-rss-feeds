The White HouseFebruary 2, 2026

Today marks the 178th anniversary of our Nation’s triumph in the Mexican-American War—a legendary victory that secured the American Southwest, reasserted American sovereignty, and expanded the promise of American independence across our majestic continent.

Guided by the steadfast belief that our Nation was destined by divine providence to expand to the golden shores of the Pacific Ocean, following the bloody War of 1812, the United States was confidently advancing westward and boldly emerging as a continental superpower unlike anything the modern world had ever seen.  The people of Texas declared independence from Mexico in 1836, and by the spring of 1846, they voted to join the United States—forcing a reckoning over unsettled border disputes.  That April, Mexican forces launched an ambush along the Rio Grande, killing 11 and wounding 6 American troops.

With the promise of Manifest Destiny beating in every American heart, President James K. Polk took swift action to defend our Nation’s security, our dignity, and our sovereign borders.  In May of 1846, the United States declared war on Mexico, with two American titans—Generals Zachary Taylor and Winfield Scott—leading the charge.  Despite being vastly outnumbered in battle, American forces consistently reigned victorious through their superior military strategy, modern military capabilities, and steadfast devotion to protecting the national interest.  After a series of victories in the Mexican territories of California and New Mexico, in a triumphant victory for American sovereignty, the United States heroically captured the capital of Mexico City in September of 1847—paving the way to the Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo on February 2, 1848, formally ceding 525,000 square miles of new land to the United States, representing 55% of pre-war territory.

Since taking office as the 47th President of the United States, guided by our victory on the fields of Mexico 178 years ago, I have spared no effort in defending our southern border against invasion, upholding the rule of law, and protecting our homeland from forces of evil, violence, and destruction.  My Administration is halting the flow of deadly drugs entering our country through Mexico, ending the invasion of illegal aliens along our southern border, and dismantling narco-terrorist networks all across the Western hemisphere.  I have secured historic trade deals with El Salvador, Argentina, Ecuador, and Guatemala, allowing greater and more streamlined market access.  We stopped a hostile foreign power from controlling the Panama Canal.  We are reestablishing American maritime dominance.  And we are aggressively pursuing an America First policy of peace through strength and will continue to reassert the Trump Corollary to the Monroe Doctrine to ensure the Hemisphere remains safe, prosperous, and free.  We will never waver in putting our people, our interests, and our country first.

On this anniversary of one of our Nation’s earliest displays of military might—and particularly as we celebrate 250 glorious years of American independence—we honor the memory of the brave men who gave their lives in service to our Nation.  One hundred and seventy-eight years later, their legacy lives on in our enduring strength, our commitment to sovereignty, and the unmatched power of the American spirit.</description>

The White HouseFebruary 4, 2026

From youth leagues and high school varsity to the Olympic Games and the heights of professional sports, for decades, women and girls have exemplified the very best of American athletics.  This National Women and Girls in Sports Day, we celebrate every female athlete for their devotion to excellence and for their incredible contributions to America’s character, culture, and unwavering competitive spirit.

Emboldened by the promise of the American Dream, through hard work, dedication, and resilience, every citizen can fulfill their God-given potential on any field, court, or track.  More than half a century ago, Title IX of the Education Amendments Act enshrined this promise into federal law, marking a pivotal moment for equal opportunity for women and girls.  Since then, the number of female athletes has grown remarkably—and my Administration remains committed to expanding opportunities for women and girls to compete, grow, and succeed at every level.

Since I took office as the 47th President of the United States, America has once again proudly championed youth athletics, which instills in our Nation’s girls the skills they need to grow stronger, develop healthy habits, and overcome challenges—not only as athletes but as young citizens.  Last year, I proudly signed multiple Executive Orders to uphold Title IX, end the unfair participation of men in women’s sports, and preserve and expand scholarships for collegiate women’s sports.  My Administration’s policy is simple:  Any program that rejects biological reality and deprives women of fair and safe athletic opportunities will not receive federal funds.  Under my leadership, every woman’s safety, dignity, and work ethic will always be protected.

Female athletes go beyond breaking records or winning championships—they redefine what is possible, elevate their sports, and inspire the next generation of girls to achieve greatness.  Today and every day, we recommit to preserving the timeless values that sports provide and to building a future where every young girl, collegiate athlete, and professional competitor pushes further, reaches higher, and dreams bigger.</description>

First Lady Melania Trump engaged in a private meeting with freed American-Israeli hostage Keith Siegel in the White House today. The First Lady’s sit-down with Aviva Siegel in January 2025 sparked a series of events that ultimately led to Keith Siegel’s liberation from Hamas.

“That first meeting with Aviva Siegel served as a catalyst to the events leading up to Keith’s freedom. It was clear that day in New York City that Aviva Siegel’s human spirit would move mountains to rescue her husband, Keith,” exclaimed First Lady Melania Trump.

“I was deeply moved to hear from the First Lady about the meetings she held with my wife, Aviva, while I was in captivity, and about the strength and support she gave to the families of the hostages throughout that difficult journey,” Keith Siegel asserted.

Aviva Siegel also participated in today’s White House meeting, saying: “I want to express my deepest gratitude to First Lady Melania Trump. Meeting again today feels profoundly full circle… I am endlessly grateful for Mrs. Trump’s steadfast support over these painful two years.”

During their initial encounter, Aviva Siegel gifted Mrs. Trump a handmade book about her husband Keith Siegel and the brutal events surrounding October 7, 2023. First Lady Melania Trump shared the handmade book and Keith Siegel’s story with President Trump later that evening in January 2025.

Keith Siegel further shared, “I am grateful to the First Lady and to the President for their tremendous efforts to secure the return of the hostages, and my own return.”</description>

The White HouseFebruary 8, 2026

This Super Bowl Sunday, I send my best wishes to the athletes and coaches of the New England Patriots and the Seattle Seahawks as they take the field and to the millions of Americans gathering across the country to watch these two storied franchises compete on one of the grandest and most legendary stages in all of sports.

As our country proudly marks 250 glorious years of American independence, tonight’s game carries special meaning.  In many ways, the story of our country’s most popular sport mirrors our own American journey.  As our Nation industrialized in the early twentieth century, football emerged in working communities and reflected the same values of grit, tenacity, and discipline that defined the American worker.  As our country’s economy expanded, the game grew along with our Nation’s prosperity.  And as advances in technology connected Americans from coast to coast, football entered households everywhere, turning Sundays into traditions shared across generations.

Before kickoff this evening, during the playing of our National Anthem, we remember the patriots who secured our independence 250 years ago through courage, sacrifice, and an unwavering belief in the cause of liberty.  We pause to honor the brave men and women of our Armed Forces who carry that legacy forward, defending and preserving our way of life throughout history and into the future.  Their service makes possible the freedoms we hold dear, including the privilege to gather with family and friends on a Sunday night to watch football and the blessing to live in the strongest and freest Nation the world has ever known.

Tonight’s game is more than just a championship—it’s a uniquely American tradition that reflects the distinct passion and perseverance of our country.  On the field, players and coaches bring years of hard work, preparation, and commitment to football’s biggest night.  Across the country, millions of fans come together to cheer on their teams and share in a moment of history.  Today, every American is a football fan.

Melania and I congratulate both teams on earning their place in Super Bowl LX, and we wish them luck as they compete for the National Football League’s iconic Vince Lombardi Trophy.  May tonight’s game reflect the best of football and the enduring triumph of the American spirit—and may the best team win!</description>
