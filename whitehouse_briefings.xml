The White HouseJanuary 16, 2026

Yesterday, President Donald J. Trump congratulated the formation of the National Committee for the Administration of Gaza (NCAG), a vital step forward in implementing Phase Two of his Comprehensive Plan to End the Gaza Conflict—a 20-point roadmap for lasting peace, stability, reconstruction, and prosperity in the region.

The NCAG will be led by Dr. Ali Sha’ath, a widely respected technocratic leader who will oversee the restoration of core public services, the rebuilding of civil institutions, and the stabilization of daily life in Gaza, while laying the foundation for long-term, self-sustaining governance. Dr. Sha’ath brings deep experience in public administration, economic development, and international engagement, and is widely respected for his pragmatic, technocratic leadership and understanding of Gaza’s institutional realities.

This milestone perfectly aligns with United Nations Security Council Resolution 2803 (2025), which endorsed President Trump’s Comprehensive Plan and welcomed the establishment of the Board of Peace. The Board of Peace will play an essential role in fulfilling all 20 points of the President’s plan, providing strategic oversight, mobilizing international resources, and ensuring accountability as Gaza transitions from conflict to peace and development.

To operationalize the Board of Peace’s vision—under the chairmanship of President Donald J. Trump—a founding Executive Board has been formed, composed of leaders with experience across diplomacy, development, infrastructure, and economic strategy. The appointed members are:

Each Executive Board member will oversee a defined portfolio critical to Gaza’s stabilization and long-term success, including, but not limited to, governance capacity-building, regional relations, reconstruction, investment attraction, large-scale funding, and capital mobilization.

In support of this operating model, the Chairman has appointed Aryeh Lightstone and Josh Gruenbaum as senior advisors to the Board of Peace, charged with leading day-to-day strategy and operations, and translating the Board’s mandate and diplomatic priorities into disciplined execution.

H.E. Nickolay Mladenov, an Executive Board member, will serve as the High Representative for Gaza. In this capacity, he will act as the on-the-ground link between the Board of Peace and the NCAG. He will support the Board’s oversight of all aspects of Gaza’s governance, reconstruction, and development, while ensuring coordination across civilian and security pillars.

To establish security, preserve peace, and establish a durable terror-free environment, Major General Jasper Jeffers has been appointed Commander of the International Stabilization Force (ISF), where he will lead security operations, support comprehensive demilitarization, and enable the safe delivery of humanitarian aid and reconstruction materials.

In support of the Office of the High Representative and the NCAG, a Gaza Executive Board is being established. The Board will help support effective governance and the delivery of best-in-class services that advance peace, stability, and prosperity for the people of Gaza. The appointed members are:

The United States remains fully committed to supporting this transitional framework, working in close partnership with Israel, key Arab nations, and the international community to achieve the objectives of the Comprehensive Plan. The President calls on all parties to cooperate fully with the NCAG, the Board of Peace, and the International Stabilization Force to ensure the swift and successful implementation of the Comprehensive Plan.

Additional Executive Board and Gaza Executive Board members will be announced over the coming weeks.</description>

The White HouseJanuary 17, 2026

Today, we celebrate the towering life and legacy of Benjamin Franklin—printer and philosopher, inventor and diplomat, public servant and patriot, and one of the most consequential Americans to ever live.  On what would have been his 320th birthday, we honor his restless genius, his steadfast devotion to liberty, and his legendary contributions to our national story.

Born on January 17, 1706, in Boston, Massachusetts, Franklin grew up the 15th of 17 children.  Raised with little formal education, he taught himself how to read and write, emerging at age 23 as one of the most successful and influential publishers in the Colonies.  He was also a passionate innovator, always striving to improve the lives of his fellow citizens through public service and the marvels of science.  Throughout his life, he invented the lightning rod and the first bifocal glasses, harnessed the power of electricity with his famous “key and kite” experiment, established the first public library and volunteer fire department, and served as the first Postmaster General, binding the Colonies together with an organized mail system long before they were bound together as one Nation.

Of his countless triumphs and successes, his most epic contributions to our Republic were those that fortified the cause of freedom.  While living in England as an ambassador for the Pennsylvania Assembly, Franklin witnessed firsthand the growing British hostility toward the Colonies.  In 1775, Franklin was selected as a delegate to the Second Continental Congress, where, together with fellow patriots John Adams and Thomas Jefferson, he helped draft the Declaration of Independence, suggesting to Jefferson that he include the immortal phrase:  “We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal.”

Franklin’s unshakable commitment to the causes of the Revolution ultimately led him across the Atlantic once more, where he played a pivotal role in securing French support for the patriot cause against the British Empire and acted as a principal negotiator of the 1783 Treaty of Paris, which ended the Revolutionary War.  After American independence was finally won, he played a vital role in rallying support for the ratification of the Constitution in 1788.  Franklin is one of only six men to have signed both the Declaration of Independence and the Constitution.

Benjamin Franklin is often remembered as the “First American”—a title that reflects a life devoted to curiosity, industry, and the cause of human freedom.  His intellect and character helped shape an American identity grounded in courage, self-reliance, and civic duty.  Franklin gave the young country confidence and direction, demonstrating how knowledge and public service could advance the cause of liberty.  His legacy endures in our institutions, our Constitution, and the very character of our Republic—a testament to how one man’s ideas and actions can echo through the history of a nation for 250 glorious years.

Happy birthday, Benjamin Franklin!</description>

Tonight, the College Football Playoff National Championship brings a season of dedication, sacrifice, and hard work to a climactic conclusion.  It stands as the final measure of months of preparation, resolve, and competition that have long defined college football—a beloved and uniquely American tradition.

For more than 150 years, college football has been a cherished fixture in American culture.  Every fall and winter, massive crowds flock to stadiums in college towns all across our Nation to witness the epic display of loyalty, rivalry, tradition, and regional identity erupting throughout the stands and on the field below.  From the very first collegiate matchup in 1869, our country’s love of this storied Saturday ritual has been passed down from one generation to the next and endured as an iconic American institution.

At its best, college football reflects our timeless American values of family, freedom, unity, and hard work and represents the pinnacle of our national spirit.  It is seen in the players whose focus, discipline, and unwavering grit are forged in every practice and workout.  It is upheld by the coaches who set high standards, demand greatness, and help cultivate incredible student-athletes—and even better Americans—who stop at nothing to achieve their God-given potential both on and off the field.  And it is sustained by the fans whose dedication gives college football its lasting meaning, passion, and glory.

Melania and I congratulate the Indiana Hoosiers and the Miami Hurricanes on making it to the College Football Playoff National Championship.  God bless the talented players and dedicated coaches, the families who love and support them, and the faithful fans who cheer them on.  May the best team win!</description>

Briefings &amp; Statements

The White HouseJanuary 22, 2026

On July 4, 1776, our Declaration of Independence righteously affirmed that every human being is endowed by Almighty God with the unalienable right to life.  In the 250 years since, our commitment to this truth has been the source of our strength and the foundation of our greatness — and it has helped America remain the single greatest force for justice and human flourishing in the history of the world.  This National Sanctity of Human Life Day, we renew our steadfast commitment to fostering a culture that respects, upholds, and cherishes the inherent dignity and infinite worth of every precious human soul.

Today marks the 53rd anniversary ofRoe v. Wade— a moral and constitutional atrocity that silenced the American people and stripped the States of their right to protect the unborn.  Thankfully, in June 2022, the United States Supreme Court corrected this disastrous decision, and decades of left-wing judicial overreach, by returning abortion policy to the American people in the States.  During my first term, I was proud to have appointed three of the Associate Justices who delivered this triumphant victory for life, liberty, and American democracy.

From the moment I returned to office as the 47th President of the United States, I have taken decisive action to protect the unborn and restore a culture that unapologetically defends the sanctity of life.  I was proud to enforce the Hyde Amendment and reinstate the Mexico City Policy — ending taxpayer-funded abortion at home and abroad.  I also pardoned 23 pro-life activists who were unfairly targeted and prosecuted by a weaponized Department of Justice (DOJ) for practicing their faith and living their conscience.  At my direction, the DOJ is now investigating the weaponization of Government against Christians and Americans of faith.

Last summer, I also proudly signed into law the One Big Beautiful Bill — a monumental win for life and the American family that expands the child tax credit, increases access to childcare, makes the paid leave tax credit permanent, protects Medicaid from funding large abortion providers, and establishes Trump accounts for newborn babies for the future of our Nation.  My Administration is also committed to supporting policies that advocate for adoption, promote foster care, and protect pregnant women and mothers.  At every level of the Federal Government, my Administration is boldly advancing policies that protect the most vulnerable among us and promote the growth and success of America’s families.

Today, we uphold the eternal truth that every human being is created in the holy image and likeness of God, blessed with infinite worth and boundless potential.  We celebrate the heroic leaders, parents, students, and everyday citizens — including those gathering for the March for Life in Washington, D.C., this weekend — who have courageously advocated for the most vulnerable and stood up for those who cannot stand up for themselves.  As President, I pledge to always be a voice for the voiceless and to never tire in fighting to protect the intrinsic dignity of every child, born and unborn.

Today, I call on the American people to join me in honoring the dignity of every human life, including those not yet born, to continue to care for women in unexpected pregnancies, and to support adoption and foster care in a more meaningful way so every child can have a loving home.  Finally, I ask every citizen of this great Nation to listen to the sound of silence caused by a generation lost to us and then to raise their voices for all affected by abortion, both seen and unseen.</description>

Briefings &amp; StatementsPresidential Message on International Holocaust Remembrance DayThe White HouseJanuary 27, 2026

Briefings &amp; Statements

The White HouseJanuary 27, 2026

This International Holocaust Remembrance Day, we remember one of the darkest periods in human history and one of the gravest atrocities the world has ever witnessed.  Today, we pay respect to the blessed memories of the millions of Jewish people, who were murdered at the hands of the Nazi Regime and its collaborators during the Holocaust— as well as the Slavs and the Roma, people with disabilities, religious leaders, persons targeted based on their sexual orientation, and political prisoners who were also targeted for systematic slaughter.  We renew our resolve that freedom, justice, and the dignity of the human person will always conquer the forces of evil, tyranny, and oppression.

On January 27, 1945, 81 years ago today, Allied forces liberated Auschwitz-Birkenau, the Nazi Regime’s largest concentration and death camp in World War II, where over one million people were marched to their senseless deaths.  Within the camp’s barbed-wire electric fence, those imprisoned there were stripped of their clothing, personal possessions, and God-given dignity.  Countless were immediately murdered, and others were subjected to forced labor, starvation, disease, torture, and medical experiments.  The barbaric conditions knew no bounds.

The systematic murder of Jewish people across Nazi-occupied Europe remains an indelible blight on mankind.  In remembrance of all who perished during the Holocaust and in honor of all those who survived and rebuilt their lives from the ashes, we renew our pledge that such evil will never again attain a stronghold in the West.  After I took office as the 47th President of the United States, I proudly made it this administration’s priority directing the Federal Government to use all appropriate legal tools to combat the scourge of anti-Semitism.  My Administration will remain a steadfast and unequivocal champion for Jewish Americans and the God-given right of every American to practice their faith freely, openly, and without fear.

On this solemn day, we remember every man, woman, and child senselessly killed by the evil, depravity, and hate of the Nazi Regime—and we commend the survivors who dedicated their lives to sharing their stories while carrying the unimaginable burden of the seen and unseen scars.  This International Holocaust Remembrance Day, and every day, we honor their enduring resilience, faith, and strength—and we recommit to the sacred truth that every human being is made in the holy image of God.</description>

On this day 40 years ago, America tragically lost 7 brilliant, visionary, and courageous titans of space exploration aboard the Space Shuttle Challenger.  On this solemn anniversary, we acknowledge that their legacies will remain forever etched upon our Nation’s memory—and we recommit to advancing mankind’s journey beyond the stars with unwavering strength and an unyielding commitment to excellence.

On the morning of January 28, 1986, millions of Americans sat in anticipation as a historic launch unfolded on live television.  Aboard the spacecraft were seven remarkable Americans—scientists, engineers, aviators, and a high school teacher chosen to help inspire the next generation of students.  Just 73 seconds after liftoff, that anticipation was shattered when mechanical failures caused the shuttle to disintegrate into the cold morning air, transforming wonder and hope into devastation and disaster in a mere instant.  Yet, from the smoke-filled sky rose a lasting resolve to honor these fallen American heroes by continuing their work and advancing the causes they cherished with greater care and unshakable purpose.

Every day, my Administration is propelling their mission forward by unleashing the full force of American innovation and technology into the next era of space exploration.  Last month, I signed an Executive Order on Ensuring American Space Superiority, which calls for a return to the Moon by 2028, lays the groundwork for a permanent American lunar presence, and will help make the United States the first nation to land an astronaut on Mars.  Under my leadership, we are empowering innovation in the commercial space industry to increase capabilities and encourage a vibrant American space economy—because American leadership in space is crucial to America’s strength, security, and future.

As we celebrate 250 years of American independence, this work is just the beginning of our next great chapter as we chart the course for a glorious American future in space.

On the day of this tragedy four decades ago, the great President Ronald Reagan declared:  “The Challenger crew was pulling us into the future, and we will continue to follow them.”  Today, under my leadership, we will continue to abide by this promise—leading boldly on Earth and beyond—as we carry their lasting legacy into a new Golden Age of American exploration and discovery.</description>

The White HouseJanuary 29, 2026

Today, we celebrate the birthday of the legendary President William McKinley—a true American trailblazer and titan of American greatness, who protected our people; expanded our blessings; and secured unprecedented growth, prosperity, and sovereignty for our beloved Nation.

Born and raised in Niles, Ohio, McKinley learned as a child the virtues of faith, duty, and respect, which would go on to define his storied career.  Following his service in the Union Army during the Civil War, he was elected to represent the people of Ohio in the United States House of Representatives, where he famously authored and passed the McKinley Tariff of 1890—a bold legislative effort to protect American workers against foreign exploitation.  He later rose to serve as governor of Ohio, emerging on the national stage as a leading voice for the forgotten men and women of America—our great workers, laborers, and tradesmen.

In 1896, McKinley ran for President and won decisively, becoming the 25th President of the United States.  As Commander in Chief, President McKinley was a fierce advocate for American greatness and heroically led our country to victory in the Spanish-American War—advancing the blessings of freedom beyond our shores.  He was also an unwavering champion for the American worker, and his historic use of tariffs fueled an economic boom that made our country stronger, wealthier, and more prosperous than ever before.

Tragically, President McKinley’s devotion to America First principles ultimately cost him his life when, in 1901, he was viciously assassinated by a deranged left-wing anarchist.  To this day, he lives on in our hearts as a martyr of American freedom.

In honor of President McKinley’s historic legacy, on my first day returning to office, I proudly restored the rightful name of Mount McKinley to America’s highest peak.  Guided by his vision, my Administration is also reestablishing a trade policy that promotes American investment and productivity, enhances our Nation’s industrial and technological advantages, defends our economic and national security, and—above all—puts American workers, manufacturers, and industries first.

On what would have been President McKinley’s 183rd birthday—and as we celebrate 250 years of American freedom and independence—we honor his memory, we remember his courage, and we renew our resolve to protect our workers, to reach further, aim higher, and achieve the full promise and glory of the American Dream.</description>
