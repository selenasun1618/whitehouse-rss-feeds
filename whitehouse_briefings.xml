The White HouseFebruary 13, 2026

For 250 years, our Nation has been built by the hard work, ingenuity, and unwavering determination of patriots who work with their skilled hands and brilliant minds to make our country strong.  This Career and Technical Education Month, we reaffirm our commitment to preparing American workers and students to carry this proud tradition forward and to equipping them with the skills they need to forge a great American future.

Every day, my Administration is working to promote and expand career and technical education to increase employment opportunities, boost productivity, and usher in a new era of economic growth marked by emerging industries and cutting-edge technologies.  Today, Americans have more pathways than ever before to develop the skills they need for success.  As the economy roars back with explosive job growth and unprecedented investments in science and technology, America’s competitiveness depends on our ability to close the gap between the demand for skill and the qualified workers ready to step up and lead.  A strong workforce drives economic growth and national innovation—creating a stronger, more secure, and more prosperous America.

My Administration is committed to increasing and enhancing career education opportunities to equip millions of workers and students with practical skills to thrive in their careers.  To advance this goal, last April, I proudly signed an Executive Order to realign federal priorities with the need for skilled and highly trained workers. Building on this effort, last July, I signed into law a new student aid program, known as Workforce Pell Grants, to support learners who want to use Federal financial assistance to enroll in short-term, in-demand fields. Then, in August, my Administration releasedAmerica’s Talent Strategyto provide a blueprint for aligning our education and workforce systems to unleash the unbridled potential of American talent. In addition, we took several actions to advance artificial intelligence education for American youth.

We are slashing ineffective programs, investing in better employment and earning outcomes, and identifying alternative methods for workers to receive credentials of value beyond a traditional higher education degree.  Through our historic Trump Accounts initiative, we are expanding financial literacy and teaching our young people the virtues of capitalism.  And we have implemented a bold plan to expand apprenticeships with the ambitious goal of reaching and surpassing one million active registered apprentices.

This month, we honor the hardworking men and women who stand at the center of American innovation, ingenuity, and determination.  My Administration will never waver in preparing our workers and students to lead our Nation into a radiant American future defined by skill, tenacity, excellence, and strength.</description>

First Lady Melania Trump shared a nostalgia-filled message about the role love letters have played in America’s military community in her remarks to military families and service members at Pope Army Airfield and Fort Bragg in North Carolina.

Mrs. Trump said, “Love letters have symbolized the union of patriotism and family devotion among our soldiers for 250 years. The harmony of love of country and love of family is what makes us uniquely American. It is this very balance which strengthens our military and builds our communities.”

President Trump and the First Lady joined the military and their families at Fort Bragg and Pope Army Airfield the day before Valentine’s Day. The First Lady added, “The President and I are grateful to be with you—to honor the passion you share through unmatched bravery, resilience, and service to our great Nation.”

President Trump and the First Lady saluted military families and the heroic members of the United States Army Special Forces who carried out the successful mission in Venezuela to bring Nicolas Maduro to justice. First Lady Melania Trump has long been an ardent supporter of America’s military.

Full Remarks by First Lady Melania Trump (As Prepared for Delivery)

On Love of Country and Love of Family

Good afternoon and thank you for your warm welcome.

The President and I are grateful to be with you—to honor the passion you share through unmatched bravery, resilience, and service to our great Nation.

Thank you for defending our freedom.

It is with immense pleasure for me to address the Fort Bragg and Pope Army Airfield community today. To our great armed forces of the United States stationed all over the world, I have a nostalgia-filled message: Happy Valentine’s Day!

Love letters have symbolized the union of patriotism and family devotion among our soldiers for 250 years. The harmony of love of country and love of family is what makes us uniquely American. It is this very balance which strengthens our military and builds our communities.

And now, it is my distinct honor to introduce your Commander-in-Chief—our leader who maintains a mission of peace through strength—President Donald J. Trump.</description>

The White HouseFebruary 15, 2026

As we await the roar of engines at the starting line of the Daytona 500, we celebrate the “Great American Race” as an iconic showcase of our Nation’s ingenuity, competitive spirit, and proud tradition of excellence.

Throughout our Nation’s 250-year history, Americans have pushed boundaries, built boldly, and steered our country toward victory.  The Daytona 500 reflects the hard work and determination that have driven our Nation forward by transforming ambition into action and innovation into progress.  America’s drive to win will continue to fuel our Nation for generations to come because we will never stop building, never stop dreaming, and never stop striving for greatness.

While NASCAR brings millions of fans together, they are united by something greater than who wins the race:  faith in God, love of family, and pride in our great American Flag.  These great American ideals extend far beyond the race track—they guide us as one Nation under God.  As the cheers of patriots echo in honor of this glorious national tradition, we are reminded of the enduring spirit of freedom that makes America strong.

Melania and I send our best wishes to all those gathered at the “World Center of Racing” for a safe and fun race, and we give thanks to the men and women of our Armed Forces, whose selflessness and devotion to duty protect the freedoms we hold dear.  May God bless you, and may He continue to bless the United States of America.</description>

The White HouseFebruary 15, 2026

Today, we honor the life and legacy of Susan B. Anthony—a true American giant and an unwavering advocate for the cause of human dignity.  On what would have been her 206th birthday, we recommit to the timeless truth she spent her life defending:  that every human being is made in the holy image of God.

Susan B. Anthony was a champion for women’s suffrage, abolition, the sanctity of life, and the dignity of work.  During her storied life, she co-founded the National Woman Suffrage Association, traveled the Nation delivering inspiring speeches to crowds of thousands, and never stopped fighting to advance the cause of liberty.  Her tireless efforts later laid the foundation for the ratification of the 19th Amendment—securing women’s right to vote.  Anthony is also remembered for her fierce moral clarity in condemning abortion and her steadfast work to end slavery.

My Administration is proudly carrying forth the torch of Anthony’s legacy by fearlessly protecting life, women, and families.  We are bolstering federal support for adoption, expanding vital resources for expectant mothers, defending equal opportunities for women and girls in athletics, ending taxpayer-funded abortion, and upholding the First Amendment freedoms that made Anthony’s extraordinary advocacy possible.

As we honor the monumental contributions of Susan B. Anthony to our great American story, we recommit as one people to building a Nation where every citizen can thrive, every child is cherished, and the blessings of liberty and justice are secured for all.</description>

Today, I send my best wishes to the millions of people of Asian heritage in the United States and around the world observing Lunar New Year and celebrating the Year of the Horse.

Lunar New Year is an ancient holiday marked by thanksgiving and joy.  It is a time to acknowledge the blessings of family and friends, reflect on the accomplishments and challenges of the past year, and plan for the future with anticipation and renewed hope.  Around the globe, Lunar New Year is ushered in with spectacular firework displays, festivals, traditional music, feasts, and gatherings, which strengthen community and family bonds.  It is also a fitting time to recognize the contributions of many legendary Asian Americans for their contributions to our culture, our prosperity, and our way of life.

Tradition holds that the horse represents momentum, vitality, passion, freedom, and adventure—traits that our Nation has embodied for 250 glorious years of American independence.  On this Lunar New Year, we celebrate these enduring virtues and carry them with us as we continue building upon America’s Golden Age.  As family, friends, and communities gather to welcome the start of Lunar New Year, the First Lady and I join in wishing you a year filled with health, happiness, good fortune, and peace.</description>

Today, I send my greetings and best wishes to all those celebrating Ramadan.

Every Ramadan stands as a reverent season of spiritual renewal, reflective meditation, and appreciation for God’s countless blessings.  This sacred time for many Americans emphasizes prayer and fasting, strengthens familial and community ties, and affirms our shared values of compassion, charity, mercy, and humility.

The God-given right to freely worship is a hallmark of our Nation and a pillar of our prosperity and strength.  For this reason, every day, my Administration is ensuring that all citizens can practice their faith, follow their conscience, and worship freely—because freedom of religion means the freedom to practice your religion proudly and without fear of persecution.

In this season of grace and goodwill, I offer my prayers for happiness and fulfillment at home, unity and peace throughout the world, and blessings in the year to come.</description>

The White HouseFebruary 18, 2026

Today, the First Lady and I join the millions of Christians in the United States and around the world in observing Ash Wednesday—a solemn day of prayer and repentance and the beginning of the Lenten season.

Every Ash Wednesday, Christians receive ashes in the shape of a cross on their foreheads as a visible reminder of our belonging to Jesus Christ and our enduring need for penance.  For the next 40 days, in remembrance of Jesus’ 40 days of temptation in the desert, followers of Christ will pray, fast, and give alms to deepen their faith, reflect on His redeeming Passion and death, and prepare their hearts for the coming Easter miracle.

As the holy season of Lent begins, we are reminded that the practices of prayer, fasting, and almsgiving have been foundational to our strength from the earliest days of our national story.  From the Colonists who turned to prayer and fasting in the heart of the Revolutionary War to the unmatched compassion and generosity of America’s churches, hospitals, and charitable institutions, these righteous acts of faith over the centuries have always stood at the center of our identity, our heritage, and our way of life.

This Ash Wednesday, as we remember the Passion and ultimate sacrifice of Christ on the cross, we send our best wishes for a meaningful Lenten season.  Above all, as we prepare for the triumphant resurrection of Jesus Christ on Easter Sunday—the greatest miracle in the history of mankind—we pause to remember those sacred words:  “This is the time of fulfillment.  The Kingdom of God is at hand.  Repent, and believe in the Gospel.”</description>

Briefings &amp; Statements

The White HouseFebruary 19, 2026

Today, our Nation commemorates the 81st anniversary of the Battle of Iwo Jima—a monumental struggle that advanced the cause of victory in the Pacific Theater during the Second World War.

Under a clear morning sky on February 19, 1945, the United States Marines prepared to storm the beaches of Iwo Jima, a remote but heavily fortified island 750 miles from Tokyo.  For years, American forces had been locked in a great island-by-island campaign across the Pacific against imperial Japan.  Iwo Jima’s capture promised a vital foothold for Allied operations and a critical step toward the enemy’s homeland.

When the first Marines charged ashore, they came under fire from Japanese defenders hidden in bunkers and tunnels carved into the island’s rocky terrain.  Determined to take the island, Marines pressed deeper inland over 5 punishing weeks, backed by the thunder of American Naval firepower and fighting yard by yard through smoke, ash, and the fire of guns amid constant shelling and ferocious infantry charges.

As the brutal fight raged on, individual acts of unmatched courage began to define the battle.  Among the countless heroes was the legendary Corporal Hershel “Woody” Williams.  Tasked with destroying deeply entrenched enemy positions, Woody advanced time and again under intense gunfire, armed with nothing but a flamethrower.  For more than 4 hours, he singlehandedly cleared a path for American tanks after the rest of his comrades fell—retreating from the front line five times to resupply before returning and successfully completing his mission.  Woody’s extraordinary valor earned him the Medal of Honor.  In total, 27 Medals of Honor were awarded for actions at Iwo Jima, the most of any single battle in World War II.

After 36 days of brutal combat, Japanese resistance ended, securing Iwo Jima’s place among the most consequential and hard-fought battles in American history.  Early in the campaign, the raising of the Stars and Stripes atop Iwo Jima’s highest peak, Mount Suribachi, became an enduring image—an unmistakable symbol of American resolve, sacrifice, and victory in the Pacific.

Of the 70,000 servicemen who fought at Iwo Jima, nearly 7,000 of America’s finest Marines gave their lives on the island in defense of our freedom—offering the full measure of their devotion to the Republic they served until their very last breath.  As we commemorate the Battle of Iwo Jima and as we celebrate 250 years of American independence, we remember the enormous sacrifices of the Greatest Generation, and we renew our solemn promise to honor their legacy by defending the liberties they secured.</description>
