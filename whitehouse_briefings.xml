Briefings &amp; Statements

The White HouseFebruary 11, 2026

Today, we celebrate our Nation’s most prolific inventor and a man who never stopped pushing the spirit of American innovation:  the legendary Thomas Edison.  On what would have been his 179th birthday, we honor his life, determination, and extraordinary legacy of American entrepreneurship and ingenuity and look to his example as we continue building the Golden Age of America.

Born into humble means in Ohio and raised in Michigan, Thomas Edison’s life represents the resilience and determination that it takes to build the American Dream.  Edison had virtually no formal education and was afflicted with deafness at a young age.  Despite these challenges, he was a voracious reader who constantly tinkered with mechanics, electricity, and scientific experiments.  In his early twenties, he received his first patent for an electrical recorder and soon devoted himself entirely to invention and innovation.  He would ultimately go on to develop more than 1,000 patents and design some of the greatest inventions of his time, including the phonograph, the motion picture camera, the alkaline storage battery, and most famously, the incandescent light bulb.  Through constant trial and error, his inventions bettered the lives of everyday Americans and people all around the world.

My Administration is proudly carrying Thomas Edison’s legacy forward into the 21st century, ushering in a new Golden Age of American innovation and ingenuity.  Since returning to office, we have empowered the next generation of innovators by deregulating industries and enacting historic tax cuts for small businesses. And I will always remain committed to ensuring America retains our competitive edge across every sphere.

As we celebrate Thomas Edison’s timeless contributions to our way of life, we are reminded that technological advancement is achieved through hard work, tenacity, and an unwavering commitment to forging a great American future.  On his birthday, I call on every American to dare to dream big, achieve the impossible, and embrace the opportunity to be an outsider because, like Thomas Edison, it is the outsiders who change the world.

Happy birthday, Thomas Edison!</description>

First Lady Melania Trump visited children with rare and serious diseases at The Children’s Inn at the National Institutes of Health (NIH) for Valentine’s Day. Mrs. Trump joined the children, their families, and staff members for an afternoon of creativity, connection, and encouragement.

“Love reveals itself in many forms, especially in the hardest moments of care and compassion,” said Mrs. Trump. “The Children’s Inn provides important support to children who have been diagnosed with rare and serious diseases. Returning to The Children’s Inn at NIH is a special reminder of warmth that exists here year-round thanks to the profound resilience of these young people and the dedication of those working to provide comfort, hope, and support during clinical trials. I wish them all a very happy Valentine’s Day.”

“We were deeply honored to welcome First Lady Melania Trump back to The Children’s Inn,” said Jennie Lucca, Chief Executive Officer of The Children’s Inn. “Her visit brought joy and comfort to our children and families at a time when compassion and encouragement mean so much. This Valentine’s Day celebration served as a heartfelt reminder that our families are surrounded by care, support, and hope throughout their medical journey.”

During her visit, Mrs. Trump made handmade valentines during arts and crafts activities with children and youth who are receiving care through NIH clinical trials. Mrs. Trump also spent time speaking with families and staff, expressing her appreciation for the compassion and dedication shown to children facing serious medical challenges.

The Children’s Inn at NIH is a nonprofit that provides a free residential “place like home” to reduce the burden of illness, make childhood possible, and help advance medical research. Families with children, teens, and young adults participating in leading-edge studies at the NIH Clinical Center, the nation’s premier biomedical research hospital, have been welcomed at The Inn since 1990.

First Lady Melania Trump previously celebrated Valentine’s Day at The Children’s Inn in 2018, 2019, and 2020, continuing a tradition of highlighting the resilience of children and families and the importance of compassion in healing.</description>

The American First Lady stated, “I appreciate that Russia and Ukraine are dedicated to bringing back the children who have been displaced because of the circumstances surrounding this conflict. Although all parties are cooperating and our communications remain robust, I urge Russia and Ukraine to intensify their efforts to ensure the safe return of every child to their families and guardians.”

Mrs. Trump and her representative continue to engage in discussions with both countries.  She added, “Today marks the third reunification since I have been working strategically with both nations. I have no doubt more progress will come.”</description>

Today, our Nation celebrates the 217th birthday of President Abraham Lincoln—one of the most legendary leaders in American history whose fearless leadership in the Civil War saved our Nation from collapse and reunited a shattered Union under one flag.

Born on February 12, 1809, in a humble one-room log cabin on the Kentucky frontier, Abraham Lincoln’s life represents the incredible potential that is uniquely fostered in America.  Largely self-taught, he educated himself by reading borrowed books by candlelight after long days of labor on his family’s farm.  From those unlikely beginnings emerged a mind of remarkable clarity and depth that would later define his leadership.  Through midwestern grit and determination, Lincoln became an accomplished attorney, a State Representative, a Member of Congress, and a brilliant orator, writer, and debater.  He was undoubtedly one of the most intelligent men of his age.

Yet with every public triumph came personal tragedy, and his life reflected the complex divisions plaguing the country in the early 19th century.  His marriage to Mary Todd brought together a slave-owning family with the man who would eventually bring slavery to an end.  While his marriage flourished, the loss of three of their four beloved children left Lincoln in a dark melancholy for the rest of his life.  He and his wife bore on their face the scars of their own grief and, eventually, the grief of our entire embattled Nation.

As slavery continued to tear the Republic apart in the 1850s, Lincoln’s opposition to the expansion of slavery quickly spread across the land.  He entered the race for the United States Senate, where his legendary debates against pro-slavery Democrat Stephen Douglas made him a nationally known figure.  In 1860, the newly founded Republican Party chose him as its standard bearer, and the American people entrusted him with the presidency of the United States.

Shortly following Lincoln’s election as our 16th president, Southern States began to secede from the Union.  During the course of four grueling years, President Lincoln led the country through its darkest days and fought tirelessly to preserve our Republic during great trial.  He commanded vast armies against the forces of the Confederacy at great cost to human life, issued the Emancipation Proclamation that freed millions from the chains of bondage, and championed the Thirteenth Amendment to expel the scourge of slavery from American soil forever.

Re-elected in triumph in 1864 amid the devastation of civil war, President Lincoln turned to the solemn work of binding up our Nation’s wounds.  Armed with resolute courage, he sought to restore the rule of law, heal the divisions of civil strife, and reclaim the enduring American principles of liberty, freedom, and prosperity—ideals that had been tested to their breaking point by years of bloodshed and bitter division.  In his crusade to restore the Union and renew its founding promises, he spread a message of reconciliation, working to unite a divided Nation around its most deeply-held values.  Tragically, his commitment to justice and peace ultimately cost him his life:  Just over a month into his second term, at the age of 56, he was killed by an assassin’s bullet on April 14, 1865.

Today, more than a century and a half after President Lincoln’s death, my Administration is honoring his legacy by defending the Constitution, enforcing law and order, advancing justice, and ensuring that government of the people, by the people, and for the people shall not perish from the earth.  We are safeguarding American workers from unfair foreign competition with strong tariffs, a principle championed by President Lincoln, who understood that strategic tariffs could strengthen industry and generate great wealth.  We are standing firmly against chaos and division, rebuilding our military to its full strength, and vigorously protecting free speech, religious liberty, and the unique American heritage that has defined us across generations—values that President Lincoln defended throughout his life, even amid the peril of civil war.

As our Republic celebrates its 250th year of independence, we dedicate ourselves to the unfinished work President Lincoln entrusted to the American people.  This historic milestone demands that we once again take up his torch, summon his courage, invoke his vision, and advance the enduring truths of our founding principles.  Guided by President Lincoln’s faith in the American people and grounded in the ideals of liberty, unity, and self-government, we stand ready to chart a new and bold course toward the next 250...</description>

The White HouseFebruary 12, 2026

The United States of America (United States) and the Republic of North Macedonia (North Macedonia) have agreed to a Framework for an Agreement on Reciprocal, Fair, and Balanced Trade (Agreement) to strengthen our bilateral economic relationship, which will provide both countries’ exporters expanded access to each other’s markets. The Agreement will strengthen our trade relationship, support shared strategic interests, promote economic growth, and deepen our transatlantic partnership.

Key terms of the Agreement will include:

• North Macedonia will eliminate customs duties for all U.S. industrial and agricultural goods exported to North Macedonia.

• The United States will maintain at 15 percent the reciprocal tariffs, as set forth in Executive Order 14257 of April 2, 2005, as amended, on originating goods of North Macedonia, and will also identify products from the list set out in Annex III to Executive Order 14346 of September 5, 2025, Potential Tariff Adjustments for Aligned Partners, as amended, to receive a zero percent reciprocal tariff rate. The United States and North Macedonia may consider other tariff modifications following conclusion of the Agreement, taking into account trade balances and other appropriate factors.

• The United States and North Macedonia will work to address U.S. concerns with non-tariff barriers imposed by North Macedonia that affect bilateral trade in priority areas.

• The United States and North Macedonia commit to hold consultations to address and prevent barriers to U.S. agricultural products in the Macedonian market.

• The United States and North Macedonia have committed to strengthen economic and national security cooperation to enhance supply chain resilience and innovation through complementary actions to address non-market policies of other countries, as well as to combat duty evasion and cooperate on investment reviews and export controls. This commitment includes cooperating to ensure that international procurement obligations benefit only those countries that have taken on the same commitments.

• The United States and North Macedonia note their intention to facilitate and enhance commercial ties.

• On energy sector opportunities, the United States and North Macedonia take note of the construction of an important new gas interconnector between North Macedonia and Greece, which will allow North Macedonia to enhance energy security and diversify energy sources, including through purchases of U.S. liquefied natural gas (LNG). North

Macedonia will commence purchase of U.S. LNG upon completion of the new gas interconnector.

• North Macedonia commits to adopt and maintain high levels of environmental protections and to effectively enforce its environmental laws.

• The United States and North Macedonia will discuss commitments on intellectual property protection and enforcement, including on geographical indications.

• The United States and North Macedonia will engage to address labor issues.

• The United States and North Macedonia recognize the importance of high-standard commitments on digital trade in order to foster an open and competitive digital economy. North Macedonia has committed not to impose a digital service tax and to support adoption of a permanent moratorium on customs duties on electronic transmissions at the World Trade Organization (WTO).

• The United States and North Macedonia recognize the importance of facilitating trade in services. North Macedonia reaffirms its commitment to the WTO Joint Initiative on Services Domestic Regulation.

The United States and North Macedonia will work to finalize the Agreement, prepare the Agreement for signature, and undertake domestic formalities in advance of the Agreement entering into force.</description>

The White HouseFebruary 13, 2026

This American Heart Month, my Administration renews our pledge to protect the American heart and to keep the American people safe, strong, healthy, and free.

Sadly, one of the gravest threats to American lives today is the deadly affliction of heart disease, which imposes hardship on untold numbers of families.  For this reason, as President, I urge every American to take charge of their health to decrease the possibility of a heart attack or stroke.  Genetics play a role in cardiovascular disease, but implementing targeted lifestyle choices and preventative measures—such as getting regular check-ups, exercising, controlling blood pressure and cholesterol, and maintaining a balanced diet—can improve the odds against illness, disability, and death for any individual regardless of family history.

Under my leadership, the Make America Healthy Again Commission is working tirelessly to improve the quality of life and longevity for every American and to ensure our healthcare system addresses the root causes of chronic disease.  My Administration has secured historic agreements with pharmaceutical manufacturers to significantly lower the price Americans pay for some of the world’s most popular drugs that can help with heart disease, obesity, and other conditions, and launched TrumpRx.gov to ensure American patients can access those lower prices.  We have also introduced the Great Healthcare Plan, building on our historic efforts to provide Most-Favored-Nation price relief for prescription drugs.  I urge Congress to enact this comprehensive plan, which will substantially benefit millions of Americans.

This American Heart Month, I encourage every citizen to make lifestyle changes and take preventative measures to improve the odds against illness, disability, and death.  We pray for the families devastated by loss, we honor the resilience of the survivors of heart disease, and above all, we rededicate ourselves to working toward a future where heart disease does not deprive the American people of long, productive, and fulfilling lives.</description>

The White HouseFebruary 13, 2026

For 250 years, our Nation has been built by the hard work, ingenuity, and unwavering determination of patriots who work with their skilled hands and brilliant minds to make our country strong.  This Career and Technical Education Month, we reaffirm our commitment to preparing American workers and students to carry this proud tradition forward and to equipping them with the skills they need to forge a great American future.

Every day, my Administration is working to promote and expand career and technical education to increase employment opportunities, boost productivity, and usher in a new era of economic growth marked by emerging industries and cutting-edge technologies.  Today, Americans have more pathways than ever before to develop the skills they need for success.  As the economy roars back with explosive job growth and unprecedented investments in science and technology, America’s competitiveness depends on our ability to close the gap between the demand for skill and the qualified workers ready to step up and lead.  A strong workforce drives economic growth and national innovation—creating a stronger, more secure, and more prosperous America.

My Administration is committed to increasing and enhancing career education opportunities to equip millions of workers and students with practical skills to thrive in their careers.  To advance this goal, last April, I proudly signed an Executive Order to realign federal priorities with the need for skilled and highly trained workers. Building on this effort, last July, I signed into law a new student aid program, known as Workforce Pell Grants, to support learners who want to use Federal financial assistance to enroll in short-term, in-demand fields. Then, in August, my Administration releasedAmerica’s Talent Strategyto provide a blueprint for aligning our education and workforce systems to unleash the unbridled potential of American talent. In addition, we took several actions to advance artificial intelligence education for American youth.

We are slashing ineffective programs, investing in better employment and earning outcomes, and identifying alternative methods for workers to receive credentials of value beyond a traditional higher education degree.  Through our historic Trump Accounts initiative, we are expanding financial literacy and teaching our young people the virtues of capitalism.  And we have implemented a bold plan to expand apprenticeships with the ambitious goal of reaching and surpassing one million active registered apprentices.

This month, we honor the hardworking men and women who stand at the center of American innovation, ingenuity, and determination.  My Administration will never waver in preparing our workers and students to lead our Nation into a radiant American future defined by skill, tenacity, excellence, and strength.</description>
