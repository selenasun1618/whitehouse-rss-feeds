The White HouseFebruary 4, 2026

From youth leagues and high school varsity to the Olympic Games and the heights of professional sports, for decades, women and girls have exemplified the very best of American athletics.  This National Women and Girls in Sports Day, we celebrate every female athlete for their devotion to excellence and for their incredible contributions to America’s character, culture, and unwavering competitive spirit.

Emboldened by the promise of the American Dream, through hard work, dedication, and resilience, every citizen can fulfill their God-given potential on any field, court, or track.  More than half a century ago, Title IX of the Education Amendments Act enshrined this promise into federal law, marking a pivotal moment for equal opportunity for women and girls.  Since then, the number of female athletes has grown remarkably—and my Administration remains committed to expanding opportunities for women and girls to compete, grow, and succeed at every level.

Since I took office as the 47th President of the United States, America has once again proudly championed youth athletics, which instills in our Nation’s girls the skills they need to grow stronger, develop healthy habits, and overcome challenges—not only as athletes but as young citizens.  Last year, I proudly signed multiple Executive Orders to uphold Title IX, end the unfair participation of men in women’s sports, and preserve and expand scholarships for collegiate women’s sports.  My Administration’s policy is simple:  Any program that rejects biological reality and deprives women of fair and safe athletic opportunities will not receive federal funds.  Under my leadership, every woman’s safety, dignity, and work ethic will always be protected.

Female athletes go beyond breaking records or winning championships—they redefine what is possible, elevate their sports, and inspire the next generation of girls to achieve greatness.  Today and every day, we recommit to preserving the timeless values that sports provide and to building a future where every young girl, collegiate athlete, and professional competitor pushes further, reaches higher, and dreams bigger.</description>

First Lady Melania Trump engaged in a private meeting with freed American-Israeli hostage Keith Siegel in the White House today. The First Lady’s sit-down with Aviva Siegel in January 2025 sparked a series of events that ultimately led to Keith Siegel’s liberation from Hamas.

“That first meeting with Aviva Siegel served as a catalyst to the events leading up to Keith’s freedom. It was clear that day in New York City that Aviva Siegel’s human spirit would move mountains to rescue her husband, Keith,” exclaimed First Lady Melania Trump.

“I was deeply moved to hear from the First Lady about the meetings she held with my wife, Aviva, while I was in captivity, and about the strength and support she gave to the families of the hostages throughout that difficult journey,” Keith Siegel asserted.

Aviva Siegel also participated in today’s White House meeting, saying: “I want to express my deepest gratitude to First Lady Melania Trump. Meeting again today feels profoundly full circle… I am endlessly grateful for Mrs. Trump’s steadfast support over these painful two years.”

During their initial encounter, Aviva Siegel gifted Mrs. Trump a handmade book about her husband Keith Siegel and the brutal events surrounding October 7, 2023. First Lady Melania Trump shared the handmade book and Keith Siegel’s story with President Trump later that evening in January 2025.

Keith Siegel further shared, “I am grateful to the First Lady and to the President for their tremendous efforts to secure the return of the hostages, and my own return.”</description>

This Super Bowl Sunday, I send my best wishes to the athletes and coaches of the New England Patriots and the Seattle Seahawks as they take the field and to the millions of Americans gathering across the country to watch these two storied franchises compete on one of the grandest and most legendary stages in all of sports.

As our country proudly marks 250 glorious years of American independence, tonight’s game carries special meaning.  In many ways, the story of our country’s most popular sport mirrors our own American journey.  As our Nation industrialized in the early twentieth century, football emerged in working communities and reflected the same values of grit, tenacity, and discipline that defined the American worker.  As our country’s economy expanded, the game grew along with our Nation’s prosperity.  And as advances in technology connected Americans from coast to coast, football entered households everywhere, turning Sundays into traditions shared across generations.

Before kickoff this evening, during the playing of our National Anthem, we remember the patriots who secured our independence 250 years ago through courage, sacrifice, and an unwavering belief in the cause of liberty.  We pause to honor the brave men and women of our Armed Forces who carry that legacy forward, defending and preserving our way of life throughout history and into the future.  Their service makes possible the freedoms we hold dear, including the privilege to gather with family and friends on a Sunday night to watch football and the blessing to live in the strongest and freest Nation the world has ever known.

Tonight’s game is more than just a championship—it’s a uniquely American tradition that reflects the distinct passion and perseverance of our country.  On the field, players and coaches bring years of hard work, preparation, and commitment to football’s biggest night.  Across the country, millions of fans come together to cheer on their teams and share in a moment of history.  Today, every American is a football fan.

Melania and I congratulate both teams on earning their place in Super Bowl LX, and we wish them luck as they compete for the National Football League’s iconic Vince Lombardi Trophy.  May tonight’s game reflect the best of football and the enduring triumph of the American spirit—and may the best team win!</description>

Briefings &amp; Statements

The White HouseFebruary 11, 2026

Today, we celebrate our Nation’s most prolific inventor and a man who never stopped pushing the spirit of American innovation:  the legendary Thomas Edison.  On what would have been his 179th birthday, we honor his life, determination, and extraordinary legacy of American entrepreneurship and ingenuity and look to his example as we continue building the Golden Age of America.

Born into humble means in Ohio and raised in Michigan, Thomas Edison’s life represents the resilience and determination that it takes to build the American Dream.  Edison had virtually no formal education and was afflicted with deafness at a young age.  Despite these challenges, he was a voracious reader who constantly tinkered with mechanics, electricity, and scientific experiments.  In his early twenties, he received his first patent for an electrical recorder and soon devoted himself entirely to invention and innovation.  He would ultimately go on to develop more than 1,000 patents and design some of the greatest inventions of his time, including the phonograph, the motion picture camera, the alkaline storage battery, and most famously, the incandescent light bulb.  Through constant trial and error, his inventions bettered the lives of everyday Americans and people all around the world.

My Administration is proudly carrying Thomas Edison’s legacy forward into the 21st century, ushering in a new Golden Age of American innovation and ingenuity.  Since returning to office, we have empowered the next generation of innovators by deregulating industries and enacting historic tax cuts for small businesses. And I will always remain committed to ensuring America retains our competitive edge across every sphere.

As we celebrate Thomas Edison’s timeless contributions to our way of life, we are reminded that technological advancement is achieved through hard work, tenacity, and an unwavering commitment to forging a great American future.  On his birthday, I call on every American to dare to dream big, achieve the impossible, and embrace the opportunity to be an outsider because, like Thomas Edison, it is the outsiders who change the world.

Happy birthday, Thomas Edison!</description>

First Lady Melania Trump visited children with rare and serious diseases at The Children’s Inn at the National Institutes of Health (NIH) for Valentine’s Day. Mrs. Trump joined the children, their families, and staff members for an afternoon of creativity, connection, and encouragement.

“Love reveals itself in many forms, especially in the hardest moments of care and compassion,” said Mrs. Trump. “The Children’s Inn provides important support to children who have been diagnosed with rare and serious diseases. Returning to The Children’s Inn at NIH is a special reminder of warmth that exists here year-round thanks to the profound resilience of these young people and the dedication of those working to provide comfort, hope, and support during clinical trials. I wish them all a very happy Valentine’s Day.”

“We were deeply honored to welcome First Lady Melania Trump back to The Children’s Inn,” said Jennie Lucca, Chief Executive Officer of The Children’s Inn. “Her visit brought joy and comfort to our children and families at a time when compassion and encouragement mean so much. This Valentine’s Day celebration served as a heartfelt reminder that our families are surrounded by care, support, and hope throughout their medical journey.”

During her visit, Mrs. Trump made handmade valentines during arts and crafts activities with children and youth who are receiving care through NIH clinical trials. Mrs. Trump also spent time speaking with families and staff, expressing her appreciation for the compassion and dedication shown to children facing serious medical challenges.

The Children’s Inn at NIH is a nonprofit that provides a free residential “place like home” to reduce the burden of illness, make childhood possible, and help advance medical research. Families with children, teens, and young adults participating in leading-edge studies at the NIH Clinical Center, the nation’s premier biomedical research hospital, have been welcomed at The Inn since 1990.

First Lady Melania Trump previously celebrated Valentine’s Day at The Children’s Inn in 2018, 2019, and 2020, continuing a tradition of highlighting the resilience of children and families and the importance of compassion in healing.</description>
